# 📘 Smart Task Analyzer

The Smart Task Analyzer is an intelligent task-prioritization system built using Django (Backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend). It analyzes tasks based on urgency, importance, effort, and dependencies to determine what the user should work on first. This project was built as part of the Singularium Internship Technical Assessment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system allows users to input tasks (via form or JSON), processes them using an intelligent scoring algorithm, and returns:

- A priority score for each task
- A sorted list of tasks
- Top 3 task suggestions
- Detailed scoring explanations
- Multiple sorting strategies
- An Eisenhower Matrix visualization (Bonus Feature)

The app is fully interactive, supports bulk JSON input, and updates dynamically each time the user analyzes new tasks.

## 🧠 Scoring Algorithm (Core Logic)

Each task receives a combined weighted score based on four major factors:

### 1. Urgency

Urgency is calculated from the due date.

- If the task is overdue, it receives the highest urgency.
- Tasks due within 0–2 days get medium urgency.
- Tasks due later get low urgency.

**Formula:**
```
days_remaining = (due_date – today).days
```

- Overdue → strong positive urgency
- 0–2 days → medium
- 2+ days → low

### 2. Importance (1–10 scale)

Higher importance significantly increases the final score.

### 3. Effort (Estimated Hours)

- Low-effort tasks get a "quick-win bonus."
- High-effort tasks get a small penalty.
- This helps bring small tasks forward.

### 4. Dependencies

- Tasks that other tasks depend on receive extra priority.
- This ensures blocking tasks appear earlier.
- Dependency weight = number of tasks that depend on this task

### Weighted Final Score (Simplified Form)

```
score = (importance × W1) + (urgency × W2) + (quick_win_bonus × W3) + (dependency_weight × W4)
```

Weights are adjusted depending on the user's selected sorting strategy.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### `POST /api/tasks/analyze/`

Accepts a list of tasks in JSON format and returns:

- Calculated scores
- Sorted tasks
- Explanation text
- Dependency cycle detection

### `GET /api/tasks/suggest/`

Returns the top 3 recommended tasks with explanation text.

## ⚡ Sorting Strategies (Frontend)

Users can choose between four prioritization strategies:

- **Fastest Wins** – Prefers low-effort tasks
- **High Impact** – Importance dominates scoring
- **Deadline Driven** – Pure urgency-based
- **Smart Balance** – The main hybrid algorithm combining all factors

Each strategy dynamically adjusts the scoring weights.

## 🖥 Frontend UI Features

- Task creation form
- Bulk JSON input box
- Analyze Tasks button
- Sorted results with:
  - Score
  - Color-coded priority level (High / Medium / Low)
  - Explanation of scoring
- Responsive updates
- Error validation (invalid JSON, missing fields)
- Eisenhower Matrix visualization (bonus feature)

## 🎁 Bonus Features Completed

### 1. Comprehensive Unit Tests

Created a suite of tests that cover:

- Basic scoring order
- Dependency-based priority changes
- Circular dependency detection
- Overdue tasks placed above future tasks
- Quick-win logic for low-effort tasks
- Handling invalid date formats safely

These tests validate the scoring system and ensure all logic remains consistent.

### 2. Eisenhower Matrix Visualization

A complete 2×2 grid that categorizes tasks into:

- Urgent & Important
- Not Urgent & Important
- Urgent & Not Important
- Not Urgent & Not Important

This matrix updates live whenever tasks are analyzed and provides a visual prioritization tool beyond just scores.
